# Financial-Model
Excel-based financial model for a hypothetical firm, integrating projected Profit & Loss, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow statements. The model applies growth-based forecasting, scenario assumptions, and supporting schedules to ensure internal accounting consistency.
This repository contains a self-initiated financial modelling project built in Microsoft Excel for a hypothetical company. The model integrates Profit & Loss, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow statements, linked through consistent accounting relationships.

The project focuses on growth-based forecasting, margin analysis, and scenario-driven assumptions to project future financial performance. Supporting schedules for assets, liabilities, and equity are included to maintain internal consistency across all statements.

Balance Sheet – Forecasted assets, liabilities, and equity with accounting linkages
Cash Flow Statement – Indirect method cash flow derived from operating, investing, and financing activities
Supporting Schedules – Fixed assets, financial liabilities, and equity schedules to ensure model consistency
